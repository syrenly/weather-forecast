### Implementations

-   Angular 18 and standalone components only;
-   folders organized mainly in a "folder-by-type" way;
-   a router exposes 2 main components: HomeComponent and ForecastComponent; guard, resolver and animations implemented;
-   the folder _ui-components_ contains the less architectural components, designed to show or search data;
-   [theme.scss](./src/theme.scss) hosts the 2 themes (light and dark), that can be switched using the SwitchThemeComponent from _ui-components_; the component is always available on the upper right corner of the view;
-   HomeComponent is an entry point where search cities;
-   ForecastComponent is the core of the application, where data are displayed using charts, tabs and list;
-   Switch for themes and the license key are managed with injection tokens;

### Main external dependencies

-   Angular Material for theme and UI Kit;
-   ChartJS for charts;
